<h2>Cover letter</h2>
<p>During the past 20 years, I have provided healthcare and educational support to a variety of clients both face to face and behind the scenes. A team player who is committed to the welfare, safeguarding, and promotion of pupils and adults with learning disabilities. A proven ability to encourage children, teens, and adults to achieve their potential by stimulating their enthusiasm for learning, making individual decisions and choices but also their determination to succeed.<br><br>For the last six years, I have become a key member of Cream providing specific ICT Communication Support with low level and High-Tech devices. Daily, I was working with a group of people who have specific needs and require a tremendous amount of care and attention. The individuals for who I provide support have a severe learning disability and complex care needs. Working 2:1 alongside dedicated Healthcare assistants ensured that the whole ‘package of care’ was tailor made and person centred, to ensure that each persons’ individual interests and demands, can be met successfully and seamlessly, promoting the philosophy of privacy, dignity, independence, choice, rights and fulfilment for all residents, within a policy of managed risk taking.<br><br>Diagnosed in 2013 with Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism. This condition results in a great deal to offer; in particular, extremely resourceful with unique skills and abilities that with access to the right support can help an organization thrive.</p>

                <p>According to the centre's IT tutor and facilitator, James Reid, a key hallmark of the learndirect approach is flexibility and dynamism.</p>
<p>"Obviously, being able to help students on a one-to-one basis is immensely valuable but here we are always thinking on our feet. For example, we discovered that eight or nine learners were all getting stuck on a particular module of the PC technicians' course. We arranged a session to guide them through their difficulties. It was a really positive exercise.</p>
<p>Interaction with the students helps expand our teaching skills, too."</p>
<p>The centre also benefits from state-of-the-art equipment, including four generously sized, separate classrooms, complete with whiteboards and full media facilities.</p>
<p>"The IT resources we have here would put many more conventional colleges to shame," explained Mr Reid. "Students here can progress relatively quickly through seven basic modules to gain the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) from the British Computer Society, which is now an internationally recognized benchmark for office computer competency."</p>

You may further break it down to 15 minutes each for morning and evening.</p>
<h4>3. Speak up to Increase Visibility</h4>
<p>Are you one of those that hide in the crowd and barely talk in meetings? Setting a personal goal to increase your visibility is something worth considering. Plan ahead before each meeting to consider the agenda and prepare to make thoughtful and meaningful contributions.</p>
<h4>5. Improve Your Emotional Intelligence</h4>
<p>You can set a goal to become less reactive to issues and pay attention to finding out the underlying emotions and motivations behind the actions of others. Learn to connect with people at their own level</p>
<p>Control my anxiety and panic in social situations-</p>
<p>Becoming self-aware in this area can help strengthen your personal and professional relationships.</p>
<p>With goals related to your relationships with other people, you can strengthen your connections and support system.</p>
